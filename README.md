TimeProfiler

Timer/Profiler for measuring time elapsed of promises


todos
 * measure in microseconds instead of milliseconds
 * make the code agnostic to the logger, so add_logger is not automatically required if not needed
 * make the code agnostic to the model, so mongoose is not automatically required if not needed
 * use Jest to test
